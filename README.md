# Shape Paragraphs
In this exercise we will practice the following:
- Attach an external stylesheet
- Control the shape of the paragraph based on font, font-size, leading (line-height), and the line length (max-width on the container).
- Implement a media query
- Use relative units (rem and em)

## Tasks
- Link the stylesheet in the HTML file
- Implement Georgia as your default typeface for the entire site. Set an appropriate size and line-height for the typeface (aim for readability). Remember that the defaults are what will be used for paragraphs. Remember to use rems for font-size and ems for line-height.
- Control the line-length of your paragraph text by controlling the width (max-width) of the container (in this case, main). Remember we are aiming for a fluid layout that works well across a range of screen sizes.
- Add space between paragraphs by setting a margin-bottom (in rems) for paragraphs.
- Add one media query to expand the range of screen sizes that the typography is comfortable to read on. Remember to aim for mobile-first and that you want the font-size to increase as the screen gets larger and farther away from the viewer's face.
- Validate your HTML and CSS.
- Make your site live.
